- 👋 Hi, I’m @eighty58five
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Github and develop my skills on QMK (Quantum Mechanical Keyboard) & ZMK (Zypher Mechanical Keyboard).
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything at the moment, i'm just feeling my way through things, but if you come across this and you have any advice please feel free to reach out. I will be very willing to give back whatever I can when i develop myself further.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
